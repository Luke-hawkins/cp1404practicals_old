# What did you see on line 1?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?

# Line one produced random numbers from 5 to 20.

# 2
# What did you see on line 2?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Could line 2 have produced a 4?

# On line two the code produced random numbers from 3 to 10 and only included odd numbers
# as range was from 3 to 10 in steps of 2.
# It couldn't produce 4 as it was not within the range function.
